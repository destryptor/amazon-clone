# Amazon Clone
>_A full fledged Amazon clone (or that is what it is supposed to be) built using React and Spring Boot_

## Running the project locally
- Clone the repository onto your device.
- Navigate to the root directory and run the command `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies.
- Next, navigate to the backend folder, and run the command `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the backend server.
- Finally, in another command shell, run `npm start` to start the frontend server.
- View the website at `localhost:3000`.

## Dependencies
Some of the important dependencies are:
- `axios`: A library to seamlessly send API requests from the frontend to the backend.
- `react`: A frontend library that allows the user to breakup the website into components, allowing reusability.
- `com.springframework.boot`: A Java library to set up backend servers.

The project is currently in progress, though it isn't on my priority list for now.
